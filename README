this python-script uses gaussian09 log-files to calculate frequencies and normal modes of a electronic state of a given molecule and uses this further to calculate the spectrum respecting Duschinsky effect as well as not respecting it.

At the moment the calculation of normal modes and frequencies works within the numeric instability due to poor precision of the gaussian-output

BOTH SPECTRAL CALCULATIONS ARE NOT CORRECT at this point. 
The duschisky-matrix and -shift have to be verified, further calculations as well.
