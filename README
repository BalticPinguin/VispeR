smallscript is a python-programme to calculate the vibronic spectra 
of molecules on the basis of calculations in G09, NWChem or GAMESS.
(it needs frequency-calculations to be done; more detailed information
on this will be provided in the documentations)

There are several options (for instance approximations to be used) 
and further parameters such as temperature which can be specified by
an input-file which is required for the calculations.
For details about the syntax and options availible see the 
documentation in docs/DOCUMENTATION.html.

The purpose of this programme is to enhance the theoretical investigation 
of molecular spectra by taking into account vibrational transitions in 
addition to the electronic ones as well for larger molecules. 
In addition to the common Franck-Condon (FC) picture, 
Duschinsky-rotated (DR) spectra can be calculated by the smallscript.
ATTENTION: THE DUSCHINSKY-SPECTRA DON'T WORK AT THE MOMENT

At the moment there are the following calculations availible:
1)  read the force constant matrix and geometries from output-files 
  provided by GAMESS-, NWchem, or G09- output files as well as fchk-files 
  from Gaussian and calculate the Huang-Rhys factors form it
2)  read quantities as in 1) but calculate Franck-Condon-spectra
  in one-particle approximation or many-particle approximations up to
  full spectrum
3)  read quantitios as in 1) and calculate a Duschinsky-rotated spectrum
  in one-particle approximation or full spectrum. For details see documentation.

for a full list of packages involved see requirements.txt. 
(lhis list is mostly for debugging-purpuses). 
The non-standard python-packages used are numpy and scipy 

Be aware that there are two branches:
a) The master-branch comprises full functionallity and uses 
  C-elements (cython). Hence this code needs to be compiled and has 
  more dependencies what can make it more complicated to install the code.
  Nevertheless it is faster.

b) the smallpythonscript-branch uses pure python (including numpy) 
   and does not have the Duschinsky-rotated spectra as options 
   (which don't work at the moment ).



   ============================================
       SMALL SCRIPT IS GOING TO CLASS NOW

That means, in this branch I will change the internal structure and add some class-objects,
hoping to make the code more readable and easier to maintain.
