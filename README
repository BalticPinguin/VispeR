Welcome to Visper, the replacement of smallscript.
This tool is intended to calculate vibronic spectra on different levels of theory
using several types of formats as input.

If you find any error or add some further functionality, please let me know
to improve the programme.


       ====================================================
       ***************** Requirements *********************
       ====================================================

Visper is written in python; so your machine needs a python2 installation (2.7)
with numpy and scipy in addition.


       ====================================================
       ******************    Usage   **********************
       ====================================================
Visper is easy to use: Unpack the files in a folder, make the main file,
smallscript.py, executable and execute it, followed by the name of your 
input-file that specifies all options.
For more detailes about these options, please have a look at doc/DOCUMENTAION.html.
