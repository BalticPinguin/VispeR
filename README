this python-script is part of my bachelor thesis on molecular physics.

==CONTENT==
The program uses gaussian09 log-files (as input-parameters 1 and 2) to calculate frequencies and normal modes of two electronic states of a given molecule and uses these quantities further to calculate the spectrum in two different ways:
1. respecting only the shift of minima between the states and using OPA
2. taking the Duschinsky effect into account, no OPA used here

At the moment the calculation of normal modes and frequencies works within the numeric instability due to poor precision of the gaussian-output.
The Duschinsky-rotation and shift vector are not verified yet, hence
BOTH SPECTRAL CALCULATIONS ARE NOT CORRECT at this point.

Further commits will fix these issues

==DOCUMENTATION==
For documentation of the code/functions, please use the html-files in folder 'doc'.
Further you can use the doc-string by the help-function (in python type help(<function-name>) and the comments in the code.
