this python-script is part of my bachelor thesis on molecular physics.

==CONTENT==
The program uses gaussian09 log-files (as input-parameters 1 and 2) to calculate frequencies and normal modes of two electronic states of a given molecule and uses these quantities further to calculate the spectrum in two different ways:
1. respecting only the shift of minima between the states and using OPA
2. taking the Duschinsky effect into account, no OPA used here

At the moment the calculation of normal modes and frequencies works within the numeric instability due to poor precision of the gaussian-output.
The Duschinsky-rotation and shift vector are not verified yet, hence
BOTH SPECTRAL CALCULATIONS ARE NOT CORRECT at this point.

Further commits will fix these issues

==REQUIREMENTS==
The programm on hand requires the non-standard-packages
numpy 
matplotlib
the latter can be, if not availible, excluded easily by commenting/removing the respective lines in the function 'calcspect'. Than no autamated plot will be possible but the data can be stored in a file for further use (see sect. 'call').

==CALL==
the programm is called by './smallscript.py [parameters] argument1 argument2'.
The parameters marked by respective flags are:
-h         call help-function (does not require any other parameters/arguments)
-o         output-file for the line-spectrum (if not given, it is not saved)
-l         level of logging (can be 'debug', 'info', 'error')
-t         temperature of the system (default: 300K)
-e         binding energy of lowest triplet state (default: 0) 
argument1: initial states log-file
argument2: log-file of final state

alternatively to the call with all parameters, they can be also written into a file (e. g, 'input'). Afterwards it can be called via
>$while read line; do echo -e `eval smallscript.py "$line"`; done <input 
from the shell. This avoids typing the arguments several times again

==DOCUMENTATION==
For documentation of the code/functions, please use the html-files in folder 'doc'.
Further you can use the doc-string by the help-function (in python type help(<function-name>) and the comments in the code.

==ISSUES==
This code is expected to have several bugs somewhere.
The Duschinsky-rotated spectrum has memory-leaks:
both: file-based as well as ram-based functions allocate too much memory and hence lead to blow-ups of memory.
   ATTENTION: These memory-allocations can lead to errors in the operating system; be careful by running it!
