<h1 id="#main">General information</h1>
<h1 id="#HR">Output from the calculation of Huang-Rhys factors</h1>
   This part will be introduced by the line <tt>Use method ... for the calculation of all quantities.</tt> in any case.
<h1 id="#FC">spectrum in Franck-Condon picture</h1>
   The calculation of FC-spectra is introduced by <tt> Calculate the line-spectrum in FC-picture with %s excitations.</tt>
   in the log-file (besides some minor information as temperature of the system, depending on the niveau of output).
   <p>The line-spectrum in onp-particle-approximation (independent of the option to nPA) is printed if 
      <tt>loglevel=0</tt>. It starts with the string <tt> Line-spectrum in One-Particle approximation:</tt>
      and has frequencies (in cm^-1) in first, intensities in second column and the mode that changes it's state
      in third culumn. With these informations, a full nPA-spectrum can be calculated.</p>
<h1 id="#DR">spectrum including Duschinsky-effect </h1>
   The calculation of spectra taking Duschinsky-effect into account starts with 
   <tt> Use the model ... for the calculation of linespectrum.</tt> followed by additional 
   statements depending on the <a href="models.html#DR-m">model</a> used.
   <p> if <tt>logging=0</tt>, the change of Cartesian coordinates is printed after the key words 
      <tt> changes of Cartesian coordinates</tt> .</p>
   <p> if <tt>logging</tt> is 0 or 1,  the Duschinsky-rotation matrix and displacement vector are printed after the 
      key words <tt> Duschinsky rotation matrix, state</tt> and <tt>Duschinsky displacement vector:</tt> respectively.</p>
<h1 id="#broaden">Broadening-calculation</h1>
   The output of this section mainly consists of all data-points
