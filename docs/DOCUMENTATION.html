<p>This is the main-page, intending to give an overview of the structure and features of smallscript as well as providing a reference for the options availible.
For the detailed technical documentation and all the code of this programme, see the pages listed directly below this text.
Further, you might stumble over some abbreviations on these pages. The most often used are:

<h1 id="main">Main:</h1>
The smallscript is a python-script for the calculation of vibronic spectra. There are different models available for it and different sub-tasks can be calculated separately.
First, smallscript can just calculate the Huang-Rhys (HR)-factors (see option  <a href="#HR"><tt>HR-fact()</tt></a> ).
Further, they can be used to calculate a line-spectrum (or one uses HR-factors that are obtained in an other way).
The line-spectrum can be calculated in a <a href="#FC">Franck-Condon</a> (FC) or <a href="#DR">Duschinsky-rotated</a> model, using different approximations. Finally, the smallscript can be used to calculate a <a href="#broaden"> broadened</a> spectrum as an option for the calculation of line spectra or using an externally given stick spectrum. The spectra in FC-scheme can be computed given HR-factors and corresponding frequencies as well.
<p>For the content and format of the input-files, which are used to determine these parameters, see <a href="#source">below</a>. 
<h2 id="call">calling the script </h2>
<p> if the script is located in the current folder  ./smallscript.py "input"
<p> if the script is located in a executable folder smallscript.py "input"

<p> where "input" is a custom file specifying all calculations to be done (see sect. input)

<h2 id="intut">INPUT</h2>
<p>The smallscript can do four different tasks that can be called separately:
<p><tt>HR-fact() </tt>         Calculate Huang-Rhys factors using G09-log files 
<p><tt>FC-spect() </tt>        Calculate spectra in FC-picture using G09-log files or HR-factors 
<p><tt>Duschinsky-spect()</tt> Calculate Duschinsky-rotated spectra using G09-log files
<p><tt>Broadening() </tt>      Calculate broadened spectra from line-spectrum 

<p>where the G09-files need to include geometry and force-constant matrix for different electronic states. Further, the sources are specified as:
<TABLE>
<TR> <TD><tt>initial: </tt>  </TD>  <TD> specifies a file for initial electronic states geometries (multiple files separated by ',')</TD> </TR>
<TR> <TD><tt>final:  </tt>   </TD>    <TD> specifies a file for final electronic states geomitries</TD> </TR>
<TR> <TD><tt> HR-file:  </tt> </TD>  <TD> specifies file containing HR-factors (1. column) and frequencies (second column) </TD> </TR>
<TR> <TD><tt> linespect: </tt> </TD><TD> specifies file containing line-spectrum (intensity  frequency  [mode-number])</TD> </TR>
<TR> <TD><tt> out: </tt>    </TD> <TD> specify file the output should be saved in; default is 'calculation.log'.
		            If the file already exists, the logging-information will be appended.</TD> </TR>

</TABLE>
<p>
The files specifying the initial and final state can be either log-files from GAMESS, NWChem or Gaussian (tested 
with g09 only) as well as fchk-files (checkpoint-files in non-binary format) from Gaussian.</p>
<p>The order of the arguments is not important; further they are read (mostly) case-insensitive.
<p>If HR-fact() and FC-spect() are both specified in the same file, the newly calculated HR-factors are taken, even if HR-file is specified.
