<h1 id="main">General Information</h1>
<p> VispeR is an acronym for <b>Vi</b>bronic <b>spe</b>ctrum <b>R</b>ostock. </p>
<p> When dealing with molecular spectra such as photo absorption/emission in the UV or visible range, photo electron spectra
    or similar, people usually consider the electronic transitions for it only. 
    Doing so, the structure of the spectra is underestimated because of the neglect of the vibrational contributions. 
    Visper is supposed to correct for this problem by estimating the vibrational structure.</p>
    <p>Among a large number of shifted and shifted/rotated harmonic oscillator <a href="models.html">models</a> describing the vibrational motion, Visper implements some of the main.
    With this, it allows to study the influence of various effects independently.</p>
    <p> The required data (such as electronic energies, Hessians and molecular geometry) are read from log-files of quantum-chemistry programs such as Gaussian or NWChem.</p>

<h2 id="#purpose">Purpose</h2>
   <table>
   <tr><td>
    <p>Visper is a python-script for calculating vibronic spectra 
    to get insight into molecular processes via calculations on different levels of theory</p>

    <p> It is meant to compute vibronic spectra for transitions between a pair of electronic states
    using informations given by <a href="log-files.html">quantum-chemical calculations </a> on these states. 
    It supports Gaussian and NWChem at the moment.</p>
    <p>Support for other program packages as well as further algorithms e.g. for the description of non-adiabatic 
    transitions are easy to add due to the class-based structure of the code, making access to different values easier.</p>

<h2 id="#require">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Visper is written in python2 and needs the non-standard packages numpy and scipy to be installed.</p>
<p>The requirements on hardware strongly depend on the problems to be solved. 
The basic calculations are possible with some Mbytes of RAM.</p>
<p> There is also an option to use a  Cpp-extension that can speed up the most demanding part of the Visper.</p>

<h2 id="#call">Calling the script</h2>
<p> Visper is invoked with an <a href="input.html">input-file</a> as only argument that contains all options
as well as the names of two log-files of quantum-chemical programs such as Gaussian or NWChem.</p>

<h1 id="model">Available models</h1>
      <ul>
         <li>HR -> This model is special in the syntax of required input-file. It calculates the spectrum from known Huang-Rhys factors
                    and respective frequencies.<a href="#HR-model">Details see here.</a></li> 
          <li>FC -> In this model, a purely harmonic spectrum is calculated in Franck-Condon picture.</li>
          <li>CFC -> This model is also Franck-Condon based but includes a correction due frequencies differing between the initial and final electronic states. </li>
        <!--  <li>DR  -> With this option, a spectrum is calculated that takes also Duschinsky rotation into account. In this model restrictions due to the
                   number of changing vibrational modes are given.</li> -->
          <li>URDR -> This model is the least restrictive; it allows for full spectrum calculation including Duschinsky rotation.</li>
      </ul>
<h1 id="code">Program code</h1>
The program is written mostly in python (there is 1 Cpp-file as well) and based on classes.
To understand the code structure and add further capabilities, please have a look at the <a href="code.html">documentation of code</a>.
