<h1 id='intro'> Introduction </h1>
<p> VispeR understands different input-formats and tries to calculate the requested data with
that values that are given.</p>
<p> However, some data are needed and not all possible print-formats can be supported.</p>
<h1 id='G09'> Gaussian-Files </h1>
<p>option <tt>Freq</tt> is needed to calculate the frequencies and print the Hessian respectively.</p>
<p> 
Gaussian has the feature that it turns the molecules always to its moment of intertia axis.
This, however, has disadvantages here: First, the direction of an axis is not defined by it and
second for symmetric molecules the order of moments of inertia changes due to (almost) degeneracy.
 One should therefor use the <tt>NoSymm</tt>-option to avoid axis-flips.</p>
<p> Also, it is (especially for larger molecules) recommended to use the formcheck-files (.fchk or .FCkh) as input
since the data therein are numerically more stable. </p>
<h1 id='NWChem'> NWChem-Files </h1>
<p>To get frequency information, specify <tt>task dft freq</tt> or the respective method of choise.</p>
<h1 id='gamess'> GAMESS-Files </h1>
Gamess-files used to be supported and maybe will be later on, but at the moment 
calculations trying to use them will fail and through errors.
