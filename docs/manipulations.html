<h1><center>Data-manipulations Visper</center></h1>
<p> During the calucalation several manipulations are done on the computed as well as the
inserted data which are, at the current state, mandatory to perform.</p>
<p> In the following sections, these manipulations are motivated and the algorithms in use are explained </p>

<h1>Assingment of Normal Modes</h1>
<p> The normal modes and respective frequencies are obtained as the eigen-system for the force constant matrix.
From the algorithm, the ordering of these modes is due to their frequency but the frequencies of the modes
change independently and hence the order between the states may change.
To correct for this, the modes in the final state are resorted according to the modes in initial state using
the overlap matrix of the eigen-vectors.</p> 
<p>To account for changes in the mode none the less, the overlap-matrix is rounded before being applied to the
final states quantities.
Unfortunately, simple rounding is not enough in cases of strong coupling between the modes 
(which is most often the case). Therefore, a more intricate algorithm is applied that follows the scheme:</p>

<h1>Reorientation of states</h1>
<p> The shift of normal modes is calculated in terms of changes in Cartesian coordinates. Hence, if due to the
relaxation of geometry the frames in the given states does not coincide, the Huang Rhys factors and hence
the vibronic structure will be overestimated.</p>
<p>Especially calculations in G09 can even have axis-flips (sign-changes and/or interchanges of coordinates) 
during the optimisation procedure, spoiling the results completely.</p>
<p>Correcting these changes, in general a translation as well as rotation is needed. </p>
<p> To correct for these changes, two algorithms are implemented in VispeR, one bringing the moment of inertia
systems in coincidence, the other minimizing the differences in geometry.</p>

<h2>moment of inertia</h2>
<p>Bringing the MOI systems in coincidence has a clear physical motivation. </p>
<p>In this programme, the following procedure is used:</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this method comes into troubles when the symmetry of the molecule is high. 
In these cases, the moments of intertia are often (almost) degenerate. Than, the order of the moments of inertia
can change between the states and the algorithm will detect a false axis-flip. The other problem likely to occur
is that in one set the axes are a linear combination of the other set, leading to a rotation that is unphysical 
either. </p> 
<p> For such systems this method is therefore not applicable.</p>

<h2>least squares</h2>
<p> Minimising the RMSD is the less physical way but it is more straight forward and robust in practice.</p>

<h1>Applying these algorithms to model systems</h1>
<p> Lets have a glance on the effect of these manipulations!</p>
