<h1 href='intro'><center>Background of the models implemented in Visper</center></h1>
<p>Visper works always in the harmonic approximation and does not account for the Jahn-Teller effect.
    If this is not valid of effects due to non-linearities should be described, this program can not be used for it.
    However, there are different levels of approximation available, requireing different amounts of input-data.
    These models are specified in Visper by the names:
<ul>
   <li><b>HR</b>: Huang-Rhys. In this model, the <a href="#HR">HR-factors</a>
        and corresponding frequencies need to be given and Visper computes the FC-progression for this.</li>
   <li><b>FC</b>: (normal) Franck-Condon. It uses Franck-Condon progressions based on the shift of normal modes
        to calculate the spectrum.</li>
   <li><b>CFC</b>: Changed Franck-Condon. In addition to the shift of the modes, the change of frequencies is
       taken into account for the calculation of intensities here.</li>
   <li><b>DR</b>: Duschinsky-Rotation. In addition to CFC, here the coupling of modes in terms of rotations
       is also taken into account.</li>
   <li><b>URDR</b>: unrestricted Duschinsky-Rotation. This method is the more consistent version of DR since it
       does not make any approximation to the changing modes </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p> The models and their differences are explained below in more detail. 
It is important to note, however, that all calculations except the URDR-spectrum are performed in one-particle approximation <a href="#FC-n">(OPA)</a>.</p>

<h1 id="intro">Introduction: Vibronic spectroscopy</h1>
The starting point here is Fermi's Golden Rule. In Born-Oppenheimer approximation and neglecting Jahn-Teller contributions, it takes the form
   <!-- MATH
   $I\propto |\langle \phi_f|\hat{\mu}|\phi_i\rangle|^2 \sum_{n,m}\prod_k|\langle \chi^k_{f,m}|\chi^k_{i,n}\rangle|^2$
   -->

with the first term being the electronic transition dipole moment (which is not taken into account here).
The overlap integrals in the sum thereafter are the overlap of nuclear wave functions, hence the vibronic progression where k denotes 
the vibrational modes and n,m specify the degree of excitation in initial and final state respectively.
<p>The nuclear wave functions are approximated as harmonic oscillators here.
   This is valid as long as the modes m and n are not too large.
   The different models that are described <a href="#detail">below</a> in more detail 
   differ in the approximations they apply to the harmonic oscillators.</p>

<h2 id="HR-fact">Shift of oscillators</h2>
   <IMG SRC="HR.png" ALT="graphical clarification of the two concepts"  style="float:left; WIDTH:300px" >
<p> The main contribution to the vibrational structure comes from a shift of the oscillators in
   initial state with respect to the ground state. 
   In the simplest case, this shift can described for each mode separately by the Huang-Rhys (HR) factor
   <!-- MATH
   $HR=\frac 12 \Delta^2 f$
   -->

   is the shift and f is the frequency of the normal mode.
   <p>
   This can be obtained either from the shift of Cartesian coordinates
   or from the gradient and the Hessian of the energy.
   Knowing the nuclear positions in both equilibrium geometries, the
   shift of Cartesian coordinates
   <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG

   can be used to determine the shift of normal modes via

      SRC="shift.png"
      ALT="$ \vec {\Delta}=\bm{M}\cdot \bm{L}\cdot \vec {\Delta X}\frac{1}{1.63}$"></SPAN>
   . Here, M is the mass matrix with M<sub>ij</sub>=(m<sub>i</sub>m<sub>j</sub>)<sup>-1/2</sup> and L 
     is the unitary transformation matrix between Cartesian coordinates and normal modes, obtained by 
     solving the full eigenvalue problem of the Hessian matrix.
   </p>
   <p>An alternative route uses the gradient g of the potential energy surface of the final state at the 
   position of the equilibrium geometry of the initial state. 
   From this, the shift of normal modes is obtained with

<h2>FC-progression (model <b>FC</b>)</h2>
In the simplest picture one assumes that the normal modes coincide in both electronic states.
This means that the curvature of the harmonic oscillator (hence the frequency) is the same 
and there is just a shift of the equilibrium position.
This yields a transition probability from initial state i to final state f of 
<p>
   <!-- MATH
   \[I^k_{m,n}=|\langle \chi^k_{f,m}|\chi^k_{i,n}\rangle|^2=e^{-\text{HR(k)}^2}\left|\sum_{i=0}^n\sum_{j=0}^m(-1)^i 
          \frac{HR(k)^{i+j}}{j!i!}\frac{n!}{(n-i)!}\sqrt{\frac{n!m!}{(n-i)!(m-j)!}}\delta(m-j,n-i)\right|^2\]

where HR(k) is the Huang-Rhys factor specifying the shift of normal modes.
The above formula yields the famous Poisson profile.</p>

<h2>Pre-known progression (model <b>HR</b>)</h2>
If the HR-factors are known from other calculations already, Visper also can be used to calculate a spectrum in the FC model using these data. Here, instead of the keywords <tt>initial:</tt> and <tt>final:</tt>,the keyword <tt>HR-file:</tt> is used to specify the file where the respective data are stored.

<h2>FC-progression advanced (model <b>CFC</b>)</h2>
In real applications, the frequencies of initial and final state in general do not coincide and hence the wave function of vibronic states 
changes its spacial extend, leading to a different overlap integral.
Usually, electronically excited states are loser bound and hence the curvature becomes less steep. 
If one accounts for the smoother wave function in the overlap integral,
the transition probability can be no more written in a closed form but is described by

<h2>Duschinsky rotation (model <b>URDR</b>)</h2>
The Franck-Condon model has one further effect that is not taken into account in any of the above models: If considering two modes,
the potential energy surface is a two-dimensional hyperbolic function that has different stiffness in the two directions.
Now it may happen that in the final state the normal modes are linear combinations of those in inital state and by this the hyperbel will
be rotated with respect to the ground state (see adjacent graph).
<p>
   <IMG SRC="DR_explain.png" ALT="figure showing the Duschinsky rotation for two modes." style="float:right;WIDTH:300px">
In the graph on the right hand side, the initial state is shown in blue. 
Since the final state (red) is rotated, both vibronic states couple with each other or, in other words, there is no full correspondence
between the vibrational states in initial and final electronic state.
This means first, that the one-particle picture is not applicable here and further, the product structure exploited above can not be conserved
in this model, making the calculations much more demanding.
</p>
<p> 
For this case we can write a recursive formula similar to the CFC-case.
However, it has a complex shape and a larger number of quantities need to be defined.
The interested reader may have a look at <cite>P.T. Ruhoff and M.A. Ratner, "Algorithms for Computing Franck-Condon Overlap integrals" Intern. J. Quant. Chem. 77, 383-390 (2000)</cite>
where these equations are explained in more detail.
</p>
<h2>simplified Duschinsky rotation (model <b>DR</b>)</h2>
Since the calculations done in URDR are really demanding, there is a simpler model implemented which 
assumes that the mode mixing is only weak and hence the modes of final states can be assigned to those
of the initial state. Than one can apply the one-particle approximation and hence reduce the amount of
calculations needed significantly. 
<p>In this model the governing equations are the same as those in URDR but only one vibrational mode
is excited.</p>

<h1 id="manipulation">Data-manipulations</h1>
<p>In some cases, the coordinates of the nuclei differ not only due to changes in the molecular structure but are shifted and/or rotated towards each other. </p>
<p> Especially when using Gaussian without the <tt>NoSymm</tt> option can lead to changes herein.</p>
<p>To account for this, Visper always shifts the molecules such that their center of mass is in the center of the coordinate system. Further rotations to the moment of inertia system or minimising the rmsd can be applied.</p>
<p> Further, the order of modes can change between the states since they change the frequency independently.
Therefore, Visper always resorts the modes of the final state such that their eigenmodes are in best
possible agreement. However, for almost degenerate modes it may happen that the assignment of the modes is
almost impossible.</p>

<h1 id="FC-n">Particle-approximations (Franck-Condon scheme)</h1>
In all models except the URDR scheme, the intensity of some vibrational transition can be factorised into the different modes.
<p>In these cases, Visper by default calculates only the factors, corresponding to one-particle approximation.</p>
<p> To obtain the full vibrational structure, the option <tt> to nPA: m </tt> 
   is needed in the <b>opt:</b>-section. 
   Here, <tt>m</tt> may be any positive integer, specifying how many combinations should be 
   taken into account per transition. </p>
<p> In most cases, here <tt>m=3</tt> is sufficient. Be aware that the number of terms grows 
  exponentially with <tt>m</tt>.</p>
