<h1 href='intro'><center>Background of the models implemented in Visper</center></h1>
<p> Visper implements several models that differ in the approximations done as well as in 
the the required intput-data. </p>
<p> The (admittadly cryptic) names of the models in the programme stand for
<ul>
   <li><b>FC</b>: (normal) Franck-Condon. It uses simple Franck-Condon progressions to calculate the spectrum.</li>
   <li><b>CFC</b>: Changed Franck-Condon. In addition to the shift of the modes, the change of frequencies is
       taken into account for the calculation of intensities as well.</li>
   <li><b>DR</b>: Duschinsky-Rotation. In addition to CFC, there the coupling of modes in terms of rotations
       is also taken into account for the frequency-calculation.</li>
   <li><b>URDR</b>: unrestricted Duschinsky-Rotation. This method is the more consistent version of DR since it
       does not make any approximation to the changeing modes </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p> The models and their differences are explained in the following in more detail. It is important to note, however,
that all calculations except the URDR-spectrum are performed in one-particle approximation (OPA), meaning that only one
vibrational mode changes its state.</p>
<p> To correct for this approximation, use the <tt>to nPA: ...</tt> option before broadening the spectrum. For the
following number being large enough, this is exact in the FC-based methods; the model DR, however, will not change by this
keyword since it is inconsistent in this respect.</p>

<h1 id="FC">FC-based models</h1>
Assuming harmonic approximation, there are two methods for deterining the shift of the two coordinates.
Both methods implemented calculate the Huang-Rhys factors<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG

is the shift of the modes in normal coordinates.

   <h3 id="HR-m,s">shift</h3>
      <p>This method needs the two electronic states to be each in their respective equilibrium 
      geometry and determines the shift by the shift of Cartesian coordinates.
      The Cartesian shift is converted into internal coordinates as
      <!-- MATH
      $\vec {\Delta}=\bm{M}\cdot \bm{L}\cdot \vec {\Delta X}\frac{1}{1.63}$
      -->

      using the L-matrix (whose line-vectors are the eigenvalues of the PES's hessian).
      <p> advantages of this method
      <ul class="navbar">
         <li> Due to the different optimisations of geometries also multiple excited states can be investigated
      </ul>

<h3 id="HR-m,c">changed</h3>
   <p> This method works similar to that shown <a href="HR-m,s">above</a> but takes explicitly into account
    that the frequencies of electronic states don't coincide and hence the overlap is different.</p>
   <p> advantages of this method
   <ul class="navbar">
      <li> more exact results since additional effects are taken into account
      <li> structure of the spectrum can change due to lifted degeneracies
   </ul>
   <p> disadvantages of this method
   <ul class="navbar">
      <li> For larger molecules this method can take longer because the HR-factors are calculated iteratively
      <li> for many (large) systems the frequencies are expected to be very close to each other
   </ul>

<h3 id="HR-m,g">gradient</h3>
   <p>In this method the from the excited state only the gradient of the PES 
      at the equilibrium geometry of the ground state is known. 
   <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
      WIDTH="111" HEIGHT="40" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
      SRC="img16.png"
      ALT="$ \Delta=F_{nm}\frac{1}{f^2\sqrt{2}}$"></SPAN> 
   <p> advantages of this method:
   <ul class="navbar">
   <li> Since the geometry is calculated only once, there is no chance of reorienation 
     of the molecule or false equilibration of the geometry
   <li> The calculations need not that much time since only one geometry-optimisation is needed
   </ul>
   Further the comparison of the two methods can be used to estimate if the harmonic approximation is still valid.

<h1 id="DR">Models in the Duschinsky picture</h1>
   Taking Duschinsky-rotation into account leads to some problems by applying further 
   approximations such as the one-particle approximation (OPA); but the full calculation is 
   not feasible (or at least not wanted) for some molecules. 
   It turned out that the main problem is that one can not simply assingn the vibrational modes 
   to each other since the modes in excited state are different from those in ground state
   Therefore smallscript has four models with differently strong approximations:
<h3 id="DR-m,s">Simple</h3>
   In this simples model, one simply neglects that the modes do not coincide, but also that 
   the order of modes may have changed and applies OPA to it.
   This can lead to unreasonable results and hence this method should never be used.
<h3 id="DR-m,r">Resort</h3>
   In this model, the modes are sorted such that the modes that are closest to each other will 
   get the same number and after this OPA is applied.
   This leads to results that will look like the Franck-Condon progressions in most cases but only small 
   corrections on the amplitudes will be found.
<h3 id="DR-m,d">Distributing</h3>
   In this model, besides the resorting of the modes, also OPA-transitions to other modes are allowed.
   It is not clear whether this model is valid..?
<h3 id="DR-m,u">URDR</h2>
   Here no one-particle approximation is applied. Instead the number of normal modes taken into 
   account is truncated as it is done in the Franck-Condon scheme.
   As in the Franck-Condon scheme, the modes taken into account explicitly are chosen by the size 
   of the respecive shift. But for these modes, the sub-system is
   calculated in full scheme.

<h1 id="FC-n">Particle-approximations (Franck-Condon scheme)</h1>
   In the Franck-Condon picture, the intensity is determined by the Franck-Condon 
   factor which is, besides some factors,
   .
   Hence the spectrum can be calculated easily from a one-particle spectrum, if one 
   knows all the intensity, frequency and changing mode for all transitions in one-particle approximation.
   <p> The full FC-spectrum can be calculated exactly, if the option <tt> to nPA: m </tt> 
   is set with <tt> m </tt> is not lower than 3*N-6 and the threshold for the HR-factors is set to <tt>0</tt>.
