concerning the spectra:

--> the spectrum in "spe" is taken from "t1-s0-broad.log" and shows the full G09-spectrum as I can reproduce
    and G09 prints it also several times. (set range)
--> The g09-spectrum in "spectra" (second-part) seems to come from "G09/t1-so-emisison.log" (standard range)
--> the g09-spectrum in "G09/t1-s0-det.spe" comes from calculation including print of Duschinsky-matrix
    and shows spectrum with correct shape but too small range; 
--> the spectrum 'ranges/acro-mimic' shows too small range but correctly shaped spectrum such as 'G09/t1-s0-det.spe'.
--> the spectrum 'ranges/acro-full' shows full spectrum as spectrum "spe" and smsc.

|--> only 't1-s0-broad' lead to a wrong shape of the spectrum.--> question of reproducability remains,
         the spectral shape as smsc can reproduce at the moment seems to be sensible...
