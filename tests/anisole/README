This test case of Anisole consists of test-calculations for the three methods:
.shift (as one type of FC-progression spectrum)
.changed( as a more enhanced type of FC-progression spectrum)
.DR (as a simple type of duschinsky-rotated spectrum)

The graphics in ref+spect3.png are calculated with smallscript (red curves) and directly with Gaussian.
The latter ones, as well as the experimental data, are taken from:
